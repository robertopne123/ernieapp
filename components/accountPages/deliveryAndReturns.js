          CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
        </span>
        <br /> Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
        applications include a Do-Not-Track (&apos;DNT&apos;) feature or setting
        you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
        about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
        stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing
        DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to
        DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
        communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for
        online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will
        inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy
        Notice.
